# Image-Processing

This repository contains all the projects which we implemented as part of the course Image Processing and Recognition(CSCI -B659).
These projects cover a wide range of topics which are mentioned below. 

• Digital image representations
• Image filtering, Fourier transforms
• Image warping and transformations
• Image formation and projection
• Feature, edge, corner, interest point detection
• Image matching and alignment
• Image segmentation
• Template matching: Hough
• Recognition: bag-of-words, shape matching, part-based models
• Learning for vision: Bayesian classifiers, SVMs
